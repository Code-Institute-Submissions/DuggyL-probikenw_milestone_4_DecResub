# FAO Code Institute
I want to apology for hand in uncompleted project. At the late stage of the project, I came across several problems during deployment using Heroku and AWS. My problems are exporting models/datas jsons to Heroku postgres and hosting project’s static files on AWS server. Due to time restraint, I couldn't find a solution in time to fix these problems.

<h1><b>Probike North Wales</b></h1>
This is a Full Stack Frameworks (Django) project for Code Institute to demonstrate what I have  learned throughout the course so far. I chose to develop an ecommerce shopping website for the local Motorcycle Training School base in North Wales (Deeside). 
The idea of the project is that Probike rents equipment to students during training and consistently asks by students what equipment they should buy for riding. After seeing an influx of new riders around the country especially in North Wales, the owner of Probike saw an opportunity to branch out from motorcycling training and offer to sell motorcycle apparel directly to students or anyone looking to buy motorcycling gears.

An online ecommerce (B2C) business specialising in motorcycling gears including helmets, clothes and maybe more in the future. Upon entering the website, from browsing products to checkout, the owner wants a website to offer a smooth and easy online shopping experience. The website also handled customer payment, which dealt with sensitive customer information which required an approach with a security conscious perspective.

There are a number of features due to time constraints that were not possible to implement at this point in time. But I believe I produced an ecommerce application that has met Probike owner requirements with more room to expand in the future.

# Design
Using Code Institute Boutuqe Ado project as baseline, I opted for a simple design, where the products themselves are the focus and there isn’t too many graphics cluttering and detract visitors. 

## Colour Scheme
- The two main primary colours used are blue, dark grey & white
- Black text on white background for readability
- Red colour to draw the visitor eyes on important contents
- The colours scheme of this project is according to Probike corporate identity guidelines. Any combinations of colours I used throughout the project is to emphasise colour contrast and prioritise readability.

## Typography
I used sans-serif Google Fonts “Montserrat” throughout the webpage to maintain cohesion across the project. Using different font weights (from Thin to Black) to convey emphasis and importance on some of the content. It has high readability and ease of scaling make Montserrat a suitable typeface for web pages.
