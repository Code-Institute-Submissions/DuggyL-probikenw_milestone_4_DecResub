# Design Brief
This is a Full Stack Frameworks (Django) project for Code Institute to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the course so far. I chose to develop an ecommerce shopping website for the local Motorcycle Training School base in North Wales (Deeside). 

The idea of the project is that Probike rents equipment to students during training and consistently asks by students what equipment they should buy for riding. After seeing an influx of new riders around the country especially in North Wales, the owner of Probike saw an opportunity to branch out from motorcycling training and offer to sell motorcycle apparel directly to students or anyone looking to buy motorcycling gears.

An online ecommerce (B2C) business specialising in motorcycling gears including helmets, clothes and maybe more in the future. Upon entering the website, from browsing products to checkout, the owner wants a website to offer a smooth and easy online shopping experience. The website also handled customer payment, which dealt with sensitive customer information which required an approach with a security conscious perspective.

There are a number of features due to time constraints that were not possible to implement at this point in time. But I believe I produced an ecommerce application that has met Probike owner requirements with more room to expand in the future. 

## As a shopper

## As a shopper, sorting and searching
- As a shopper, I can sort the list of available products.
- As a shopper, I can sort a specific category of products. I can find the best-priced or best-rated products in specific categories or sort the products in that category by name.
- As a shopper, I can search for a product by name or description.
- As a shopper, I can easily see the products I’ve searched for and the number of results.

## As store owner, admin and store management
- As a store owner, I can add, delete, and edit products on my store. I can change product names, descriptions, images, prices and other product criteria.

## Design
Using Code Institute Boutuqe Ado project as baseline, I opted for a simple design, where the products themselves are the focus. And there aren't too many graphics cluttering and detract visitors. 

## Colour Scheme
The two main primary colours used are blue & white.
The colours scheme of this project is according to Probike corporate identity guidelines. Any combinations of colours I used throughout the project is to emphasise colour contrast and prioritise readability.

## Typography
I used sans-serif Google Fonts “Montserrat” throughout the webpage to maintain cohesion across the project. Using different font weights (from Thin to Black) to convey emphasis and importance on some of the content. It has high readability and ease of scaling make Montserrat a suitable typeface for web pages.

# Features

## Homepage
- The homepage greets visitors with a big hero image of a motorcycle racer, an idea to draw attention as soon as they open the site. The homepage is deliberately kept simple and communicates with visitors directly using a single image letting visitors know what this website is about. A big button to invite shoppers and see what the store has to offer.

## Product / Product Details Page
- The categories of products are bold and obvious, for the shopper ease of navigation to browse products of their choice. In order to make the products take centre stage, I chose to display the product as big as possible on all screen sizes. The name of the products are big and easy to read, right below the name, all the information the shoppers need at first glance. By clicking on the products images, will lead to the product details page for more information about products.
- The options to select size and quantity will not appear if selected product run out of stock. The product page details page will inform the shopper of how many the store currently have in stock, if the stock is 0 it will say  “out of stock”. The ‘add to cart’ button will place the selected item into the shopping cart. 

## Navigation Bar
- The Navigation bar at the top of all pages maintains a consistent look across the website. It contains links to homepage, login, profile, search bar, and shopping basket if the shoppers are already logged in. 

## Login Page
- Only available when the user is not logged in. The login link in the navbar will direct the user to the login page where they can login or register a new account.

## Profile Page
- User profile can be clicked from the navbar. This will only be available to visitors who are logged in. The profile page contained visitors' information and ordered history. 
- Only available to logged in users. Clicking on the username will present the user with two options; Profile and Logout. Profile will direct the user to the user's profile area and Logout will log the user out and direct them to a logout page notifying the user they have been logged out and offer an option to sign in again.
- Shoppers can view their order history in the Orders History section, and update their personal information.

## Shopping Cart
- Only available to logged in users. Clicking the cart will direct the shoppers to the cart page providing there are items in the users cart, otherwise they will receive an alert. The number of items within the user's cart is visible next to the cart icon.
- Users can view their shopping cart which will list all items they have ‘Added to cart’, including quantity and a total price for all items. User can adjust the quanity of items in their cart or remove completely.

## Checkout

The users inout their address, the address will be saved for future use. User cannot proceed to the payment section until all field of delivery address have been complete.

## User notification

## Features to add
